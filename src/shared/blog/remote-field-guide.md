I’m William. I've worked as a full-time remote IC in both Edge Engineering and Productivity at Netflix. With the recent threat coronavirus poses to office culture, I thought it timely to start capturing the work remote employees have done reconciling their approach to work with office culture.  In the event you find yourself unexpectedly working from home, I hope this document will help you acclimate.

## Remote Isn’t Special

Much of what can make you successful with remote is what makes companies successful in general. I feel remote highlights a lot the shortcomings teams have in their processes that office culture is able to partially mask. Remote is more susceptible to having those problems show through since communication needs to be deliberate, there is less opportunity for organic interaction.

I’m biased, I work at Netflix, but I feelNetflix’s culture is an excellent example of how a company should be run. I believe Netflix's cultural values sit squarely inside the venn diagram of what helps you be successful with remote. Take some time to study our culture and think about what they mean for you in the context of remote.

## Written Context

Offices make lossy communication easy. Watercooler conversations are an efficient way to communicate. Folks walk away from a watercooler with valuable context but that context is isolated to that group. Given sufficient time this will evolve into a culture of tribal knowledge.

This is the hardest part of being remote. To be effective as a remote employee you need to be comfortable admitting that you don’t have context. You will need to take on the responsibility of identifying watercooler context and pulling it down into written form. It’s a muscle worth exercising; you’ll find that it’s equally effective at identifying and bridging silos of communication (i.e. private slack channels) as it is connecting remote employees with office culture.

## Emojis

Written text isn’t great for conveying intent the way face-to-face conversations are. Facial expressions, tone, cadence, and body language contribute to how we interpret the intent behind words. The same set of words can be interpreted as condescending in one context and well intentioned in another.

Emojis may not seem professional but they help convey the intent behind our words. Putting a smiley face at the end of a slack message queues the reader into how our words should be interpreted. Consistently giving these queues can be the difference between being seen as brilliant jerk and a stunning colleague.

## Seek Feedback
Every team has its own idiosyncrasies. Being successful with remote requires reconciling remote work with your team dynamics. This requires taking on that responsibility; while your team should be prepared to support you as a remote employee you should strive to shield your team from you being remote. Don’t make remote your team’s problem; proactively seek feedback from your team and peers. Some great questions to ask:

  * How has me being remote impacted your work?
  * How has my communication been since working remote?
  * Is there any context about me or my work you feel like you’re missing?
  * Do you feel like you’ve taken on an increased in-person support burden since I’ve left the office?

## Remote is not Local

Working in an office environment and working remotely are different. When first going remote, some try to simulate a local presence through clever workplace hacks (i.e. teleconferencing into their cubicle). This starts from the assumption that maintaining an office presence is better than leaning into remote, it removes many opportunities for learning, and puts the remote employee in the position of dealing with both office culture and remote culture on day one. This carries double the expectations and double the chances of failure; you can now fail at pretending to be in an office or fail at being remote!

If your team has never worked with remote employees, there are a lot of unknown unknowns to discover. When going remote lean into being remote. This creates the opportunity to learn how remote works with your team upfront. Clever communication strategies can be developed in response to, instead of in anticipation of, the feedback you receive from your team.

## Include Remote Employees

Something about video conferences can make it hard to find the space to speak. Team members who are less vocal can find themselves marginalized. If you haven’t heard from someone in a while, ask for their input by name to pull them into the conversation. If you see someone unmuting themselves frequently without saying anything, it’s likely they are trying to find an opportunity to talk.

## Don’t Overwork Yourself

Going into remote work, you may be worried finding the motivation to work at home will be the biggest challenge. Most remote employee’s I’ve met have the opposite problem. By blending the spaces you work and live in, your brain can have a hard time getting out of work mode. If you let it, work will take over your personal life.

There is always one more quick thing you can do: checking slack, sending an email, or patching a bug. This is short term thinking. If you don’t stop yourself, you’ll find you’ve been running a sprint instead of a marathon and will burn out.

Remote work can be a very rewarding lifestyle if you work at it. Lunch breaks can be spent at the park with your family, while thinking about a hard problem you can get some chores done freeing you up to relax in the evening, and you don’t have a commute so you get all that time back to spend on life. But this isn’t the default lifestyle for most; most default to being a workaholics at home.

## Identify Your Working Patterns

You will find a lot of advice online about how to structure your life as a remote employee. I’ve found there isn’t a one-size fits all recommendation. A coffee shop may be an extremely effective environment for one person to work and be disastrous for another. Some people work from the couch just fine, but I have to have dedicated office space at home or my brain can’t get into work mode.

If you want to structure your environment to effectively work remote, you need to become hyper aware of your own working habits. Under what conditions do you find yourself getting distracted? What hours of the day are most productive for you? What impact does sunlight have on your mood and productivity? Ask questions, run experiments, constantly be learning and improving.

## Remote is Privileged

Acclimating to remote work will be easier for some than others. If you have a large home with a higher quality of day-to-day living, working at home will come easier. Depending on your socioeconomic and family conditions, you may find conditions at home don’t provide a great environment for focus.

Personally, for me, working from home has a lot to do with my kid. I get to spend my lunch break with my daughter. That is awesome. But I have a house with enough space to have a dedicated office, so I’m not trying to work where she is playing. When I worked remotely in a tiny NYC apartment, I didn’t have a kid. Working from home meant sitting on the couch by myself. It was easy to find focus there.

I wish I had some insight to provide here to help. The best I can do is call it out so you are prepared. If you live in close quarters with family members, you may find it challenging to work from home. Hopefully someone can comment and share some insight on how to be effective in an environment like this.

# General Teleconference Tips

  * If you aren’t talking, mute your microphone.
  * Have a dedicated quiet place for making calls; microphones will pick up background noise and people are often too polite to tell you.
  * Invest in a nice pair of headphones like the WH1000XM3 or the QC35
  * Test your teleconferencing setup before meetings.
    * Google meet shows green bars on your video feed. If those green bars are moving when you talk it means your microphone is picking up your voice.
    * In Google meet, under settings, you can play a test tone to validate your headphones work.
    * You can dial into a test meeting with another device (i.e. cellphone using a pair of headphones) to validate your setup is working and not picking up background noise.
