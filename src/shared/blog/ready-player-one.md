The movie itself is just a mainline injection of nostalgia. The storyline is rather weak. It is a take on society with late stage VR. The year is 2040ish and it appears everyone has standardized on playing a single VR based MMORPG. The creator (and apparently sole designer) of the game has died and left the "keys to the empire" hidden away in the game as a series of easter eggs. Whoever finds all the easter eggs inherits the game, and apparently the rights to make decisions about how the game is structured.

The antagonist of the story is a large corporation that sells mods in-game. They want to acquire the rights to the video game in order to maximize its profitability by making significant changes. Essentially they want to turn it into this pay-to-play, advertising ridden, nightmare of an experience.

**STOP!**

I'm already bored with this. We aren't talking high stakes here. The worst case scenario is that this company takes over the game and ruins it. Someone builds a new game and everyone re-standardizes. The protagonist isn't saving the world here.

**BUT!**

The world surrounding the storyline is the most interesting part of the movie. This world is only given a handful of minutes of attention, but in those few minutes it tells a fascinating story about the importance of a government overseeing free markets.

It is obvious that there _is_ a governing body here. There are clear contracts that are established between individuals and companies throughout the story, and there is police intervention on several occasions. This is a society with laws that are enforced.

Yet, the "stakes on the table" for the protagonist in the story is that the evil corporate company seeking to take over the game runs literal _labor camps_. This company offers loans to people so that they can purchase items in-game. These loans are on extremely unfavorable terms and are blatant debt traps. When people aren't able to repay these loans, the company offers them a job doing work in-game and gives them housing. The company controls their salary and the cost of the housing, keeping them in perpetual debt until they die.

This isn't a story about a kid fighting to save a video game. This is a story about a society where the government hasn't regulated away debt traps. The day wasn't saved when the antagonist prevailed. If a company that sells in-game mods is able to run literal _labor camps_, I can't even begin to imagine what the rest of this society looks like.
